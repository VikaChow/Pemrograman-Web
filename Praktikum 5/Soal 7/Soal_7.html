                        A baby elephant hangs out with its<br>
                        mom, aunts, and great aunts, and<br>
                        maybe even its grandmother.

                <p>
                    It's hard to tell what goes through a baby elephant's mind when its mom is trying to put
                    it to sleep. Do you think baby elephants wake up in the middle of the night and cry? Do
                    their moms and dads take turns getting up with them to rock them back to sleep? How
                    do you rock an elephant, anyway?
                </p>
                <p>
                    And what about gorillas? Today in the paper there's a story about a new gorilla that was
                    just born in Franklin Park. Its mom is holding on to it just like any proud human mom. And I have to wonder if they go
                    through as much drama as that human mom when it comes to sleep, food, and running
                    into the street.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why is it so easy for them? Are they better parents? Do they just not worry
                    about every little detail? I've never known a gorilla to read and study
                    seventeen books on bringing up baby gorillas. And they seem to
                    know just what to do. They never worry about spoiling their little gorilla
                    babies. They never worry about not having enough time with them. Now,
                    don't get me wrong. I'd rather be human than a gorilla any day. Just imagine
                    having to sit in a zoo. Forget discrete nursing... (Did you figure out yet that
                    while gorillas were on my mind, I could only find a picture of an elephant?)
